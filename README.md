# React and Vite Application

Welcome to the React and Vite application setup guide. This document will walk you through the steps needed to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrajwolNeupane/slash_plus_frontend_assignement.git
```

### 2. Open the Project in Your Code Editor

Navigate to the project directory and open it in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code).

```bash
cd slash_plus_frontend_assignement
code .
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

In the terminal, run the following command to install all necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the dependencies listed.

### 4. Setup Environment Variables

You should have received an email with the necessary environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the variables there.

### 5. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, make sure to:

1. Check that you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed.
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed by running `npm install` again.
3. Verify that your environment variables are correctly set up in the `.env` file.
